/// Where an unlisted room's key lives between "I have the link" and "the room
/// is open" — and, just as much, where it does not.
///
/// The key is the URL fragment (`#k=…&s=…`). A fragment never reaches the
/// server, which is why it was put there, but the browser does write the full
/// URL into its history, and a browser with sync on copies that history to its
/// vendor. So the address bar is the one place the key should not stay:
///
///   - Opening a room from inside RÚNA (creating one, or pasting a link into
///     Join a room) hands the key over in memory. It never enters the address
///     bar, so no history entry ever carries it.
///   - Arriving from a clicked link, the key is taken out of the address bar
///     as the page starts. The browser may already have recorded the address
///     it was opened with; nothing a page does can reach that entry, which is
///     why the README tells people at risk to paste links into Join instead.
///   - An everyday room then keeps the key in this tab's history *state*,
///     which is not the address, not shown in history, and not synced, so a
///     refresh still works. A highest-security room keeps it in memory only:
///     refresh, and the tab has forgotten it.
